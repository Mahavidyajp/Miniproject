## Guardian Angel – AI-Powered Hidden SOS Emergency Alert System
Guardian Angel is an intelligent emergency alert system designed to provide covert and real-time protection for individuals in dangerous situations by disguising the application as a normal utility app and using AI-based threat detection to trigger SOS alerts automatically.

## About
Guardian Angel is an AI-driven safety application developed to enhance personal security for users, especially women, children, and individuals traveling alone. Unlike traditional SOS applications that rely on visible panic buttons, this system operates in a stealth mode, appearing as a calculator, notes, or calendar application. Emergency activation is triggered through secret codes, gestures, voice commands, device shakes, or missed safety timers.

The system continuously monitors user context such as location movement, environmental audio stress, and predefined safety rules. Upon detecting danger, it activates live location tracking, captures audio/video evidence, and sends instant alerts to guardians and administrators. This approach ensures emergency response even when the user is unable to manually request help.

## Features

- Hidden SOS activation using calculator, notes, or calendar disguise
- Multi-trigger emergency detection (voice, gesture, shake, timer, geo-fence)
- AI-based real-time threat severity analysis
- Live location tracking and emergency alerts
- Speed dial and safety timer mechanism
- Guardian and Admin dashboards with real-time monitoring
- Secure audio/video evidence capture
- High scalability and modular architecture
- Low response time with real-time processing

## Requirements
* Operating System: Windows 10 / Ubuntu (64-bit)
* Development Environment: JavaScript (Node.js) / Python (for AI services)
* AI & ML Frameworks TensorFlow.js for voice and gesture analysis, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition
* Frontend & UI: React.js with Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion for animations
* Backend & Realtime: Node.js + Express, MongoDB / Firebase, Socket.IO for real-time updates
* IDE: Visual Studio Code
* Maps & Communication : Google Maps / Mapbox API, Twilio for SMS and emergency calls

## Results and Impact
Guardian Angel significantly improves personal safety by transforming emergency response from a manual action into an intelligent, predictive, and invisible system. The integration of AI, real-time tracking, and covert activation reduces response time and increases the likelihood of timely intervention. The project demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in personal safety, smart cities, and emergency management systems.
